# 1. Component and Props 
## Passing Props to Component
    + React components use props to communicate with each other.
    + Every parent cemppnent can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
    + Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
### Familiar Props :
    Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the props you can pass to an <img>:
``` One ways data binding is throws props from Parent to Child.
```

# 3. RenderList 
+ You will often want to display multiple similar components from a     collection of data.You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data. On this example, you'll use ```filter()``` and ```map()``` with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.
